# Commercial License Summary

This summary is provided for convenience and does not replace the full Commercial License.
The Commercial License is a separate agreement offered by Volodymyr Papush (21CNCStudio).

Why it exists
- The firmware in this repository is GPL-3.0-or-later. GPL allows commercial use, but distributing
  firmware requires providing Corresponding Source under the GPL.
- Some businesses want to distribute devices while keeping firmware modifications proprietary.

What the Commercial License allows (summary)
- Distribute Project Aura firmware in binary form without the GPL source disclosure obligations
  for your proprietary modifications.
- Sell devices that include the firmware.
- Sell enclosures based on the Project Aura 3D models.
- Use Project Aura trademarks only as explicitly granted (see TRADEMARKS.md).

What it does not allow
- Claim that your product is "Official" or "Certified" unless explicitly authorized.
- Use Project Aura logos or branding outside the scope of the license.
- Transfer or sublicense the license to third parties, unless the license explicitly allows it.
