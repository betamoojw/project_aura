# Commercial License Summary

This summary is provided for convenience and does not replace the full Commercial License.
The Commercial License is a separate agreement offered by Volodymyr Papush (21CNCStudio).

Why it exists
- The firmware in this repository is GPL-3.0-or-later. GPL allows commercial use, but distributing
  firmware requires providing Corresponding Source under the GPL.
- Some businesses want to distribute devices while keeping firmware modifications proprietary.

What the Commercial License allows (summary)
- Distribute Project Aura firmware in binary form without the GPL source disclosure obligations
  for your proprietary modifications.
- Sell devices that include the firmware.
- Sell enclosures based on the Project Aura 3D models.
- Use text-only branding ("Project Aura" and "developed by 21CNCStudio") as described in
  TRADEMARKS.md.
- Ship devices either with text co-branding or as white-label with your own branding.
- Use of logos or stylized branding requires explicit written permission (see TRADEMARKS.md).

What it does not allow
- Claim that your product is "Official" or "Certified" unless explicitly authorized.
- Claim authorship of Project Aura or represent it as your original work.
- Use Project Aura logos or branding outside the scope of the license.
- Resell or share the digital design files (STL/3MF/STEP/PDF) unless explicitly authorized.
- Transfer or sublicense the license to third parties, unless the license explicitly allows it.

Attribution
- Attribution is appreciated but not required unless explicitly stated in the full Commercial License.
